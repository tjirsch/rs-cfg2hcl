name: Attach Checksum to Release

# Fires when the Release workflow (cargo-dist) completes successfully.
#
# We use workflow_run instead of "release: published" because GitHub does NOT
# chain workflow events that are triggered by GITHUB_TOKEN.  cargo-dist creates
# the GitHub release with GITHUB_TOKEN, so a "release: published" listener
# never fires.  workflow_run is not subject to this restriction.
#
# cfg2hcl self-update fetches and verifies this sidecar before
# executing the installer — if the file is absent, self-update aborts.
